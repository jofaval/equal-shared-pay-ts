## Purpose

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Different people with different incomes can bring the same effort to the table.

It's also a because project. A fun and inspiring reason, to create some "algorithm" that can allow different backgrounds to feel included and to actually help the same as others with higher incomes.

Why should someone with **lower** income be putting **more** percentage for something if their partner with **higher** income is actually putting **less** percentage?

## Tech Stack

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

I've chosen a web stack so that it can actually be hosted almost everywhere without an actual cost

- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Github Actions & Pages

### Why no framework?

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Simple and quick project, it's strength resides in the algorithm, not the UI

### Why JSDoc?

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Typing is necessary, build step might be annoying, but, while I love TypeScript, I just want to try out JSDoc properly.

Might end up typing it with TypeScript and module declarations
